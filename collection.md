You can group your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them by category. Here are a few examples of collections that you might create:

* clothes for men, women, or children
* items of a certain type, such as lamps, cushions, or rugs
* items on sale
* items in a certain size or color
* seasonal products, such as holiday cards and decorations

After you create a collection, it can be shown on your online store as a webpage with a gallery of the products that are in the collection. Your customers can then click a product image on the collection page to visit a specific product's page. You can help customers find and view collections by [adding links](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections/make-collections-findable) to the collections in a menu in your store's navigation.

The exact layout and appearance of collection pages depends on your theme.


## Customize Collection Page by Sections

      Eg.

From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store &gt; Themes**

* Find the theme that you want to edit and click **Customize**
* From the top bar drop-down menu, select the type of page that you want to edit. **Select** **Collection pages**

**Note:** 

* Shopify only support for only **1 Collection page template** to customize at Section **Select**.
* Collection is not support to use `view=alternative_template_name` when you customize Sections. 

In order to customize collection template, you should change right handle collection as template.

```
  Eg. .../editor#/collections/birthday-gifts
  -> customize collection default
  Eg. .../editor#/collections/kitchen-things
  -> customize collection infinite (as I assign kitchen-things to display Infinite template before)
```
Or you may assign collection template to default collection page and change it to config one by one.
