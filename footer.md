## Customize Footer Section

#### Steps

From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store &gt; Themes**

* Find the theme that you want to edit and click **Customize**
* From the top bar drop-down menu, Select ** Home Page**
* Select **Footer** Section

Now you will show Footer Setting theme options:

* Logo Image / Logo Size / Logo type
* Add Contents
  * Logo: show logo at footer 
  * Menu items: show

**Note:  All block contents will show at 1 row only, Please set total block contents width options equal to 12.**

Our standard grid has 12 columns. It's mean 12 columns \( grids\)  equal to the entire page width.

So a 6 grid column  would be 50% of the containing blocks width. An 8 would be 3/4th \(75%\) width.

When you select auto, it's will device as equal

Eg. 

![](/assets/footer-grid.png)
* Logo -  4
* Menu item -  auto
* Menu item - auto
* Menu item - auto

It's mean that each Menu item will has width equal to **8/3**
