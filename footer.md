## Customize Footer Section

#### Steps

From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store &gt; Themes**

* Find the theme that you want to edit and click **Customize**
* From the top bar drop-down menu, Select ** Home Page**
* Select **Footer** Section

Now you will show Footer Setting theme options:

* Section Layout Mode
* Footer Icons
* Contents
  * Logo: show logo at footer 
    * Limit 1 block only
  * Menu items: show
  * Information
    * Limit 1 block only
  * Subcrible form
    * Limit 1 block only

**Note:  All block contents will show at 1 row only, Please set total block contents width options equal to 12.**

Our standard grid has 12 columns. It's mean 12 columns \( grids\)  equal to the entire page width.

So a 6 grid column  would be 50% of the containing blocks width. An 8 would be 3/4th \(75%\) width.

* Logo 3
* Menu items 2
* Information 3
* Subcrible form 4
